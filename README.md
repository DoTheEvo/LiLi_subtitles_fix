subtitles from [subscene.com](https://subscene.com/) have occasionally this issue where lower case l is replaced with capital I, not everywhere just enough to be reaIIy annoying if your font shows the difference

this script tries to fix that

* get the script
* make it executable or run with `python3 subtitles_fix.py ...`
* copy the subtitles to the same folder as the script
* run the fix passing the subtitles as argument
